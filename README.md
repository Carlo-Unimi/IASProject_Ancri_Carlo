# IASProject_Ancri_Carlo
Applied Sound Informatics Project, MATLAB module, written by Ancri Carlo.
The program extracts features from audio files belonging to three different "classes" (crow, wind, and engine), 
then trains classification models on this data. Features are extracted in both the time and frequency domains to analyze the signal from multiple perspectives.
